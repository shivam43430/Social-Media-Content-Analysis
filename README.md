# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization

A hypothetical client called Social Buzz wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

## Task 1 : Project Understanding ###(Raw Data folder)

Read and analyzed a client project brief to understand the client and business problem, identified the requirements that need to be delivered, and identified which tasks I need to focus on as a data analyst.
 
## Task 2 : Data Cleaning & Modeling
(Analysis.xlsx)

To determine the answer to the client’s business question, I followed these steps:

1. Requirements gathering : identified which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

2. Data cleaning : Cleaned the data by:

    1.removing rows that have values which are missing,
    2.changing the data type of some values within a column, and
    3.removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

3. Data modelling : Used VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, SUMIF, INDEX & MATCH functions to merge datasets to prepare the data for analysis.
   1.Created a final data set by merging your three tables together
   2.Figured out the Top 5 performing categories

## Task 3 : Data Visualization & Storytelling   
(Analytics.pptx)

Chose the data visualizations that best support the story I want to tell to the client. Created a PowerPoint presentation that reports on the client’s content performance.

There are also some other interesting insights that we want to share. For example:

 1.Animals and Science are the two most popular categories.
 2.16 unique categories have been found.
 3.Highest Reactions in 'Animals' Category: 1897
 4.Highest number of posts in the Month of ‘May’
 5.Sentiment Analysis: Positive Reactions: More than 56% and Negative and Neutral Reactions: Combined rest
