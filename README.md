# Data Analytics and Visualization (Accenture) 

A hypothetical client called Social Buzz wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

# Task 1 : Project Understanding 
Read and analyzed a client project brief to understand the client and business problem, identified the requirements that need to be delivered, and identified which tasks I need to focus on as a data analyst.

# Task 2 : Data Cleaning & Modeling
To determine the answer to the client’s business question, I followed these steps:

1. Requirements gathering : identified which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

2. Data cleaning : Cleaned the data by:

 -removing rows that have values which are missing,
 -changing the data type of some values within a column, and
 -removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

3. Data modelling : Used VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, SUMIF, INDEX & MATCH functions to merge datasets to prepare the data for analysis.
   
    Created a final data set by merging your three tables together
    Figured out the Top 5 performing categories

# Task 3 : Data Visualization & Storytelling      
Chose the data visualizations that best support the story I want to tell to the client. Created a PowerPoint presentation that reports on the client’s content performance.

There are also some other interesting insights that we want to share. For example:

-Animals and Science are the two most popular categories.
-16 unique categories have been found.
-Highest Reactions in 'Animals' Category: 1897
-Highest number of posts in the Month of ‘May’
-Sentiment Analysis:     
 Positive Reactions: More than 56%
 Negative and Neutral Reactions: Combined rest
